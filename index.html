        Hello everyone! My name is Nishant Kashyap. I am again going to make this website in Visual Studio Code(But this information is not important). This website is going to be about the Impact of Climate Change on Different Cultures Around the World. So, let us get started
        <hr color = "red" size = 26%>
        <b><center>Impact of Climate Changes on Different Cultures Around the World</center></b>
        <br>
        So, to know about the issue, we need to know about climate change. Climate change occurs when there is so much of Carbon Dioxide in the air, that the atmosphere gets heated up to much, and then, the climate changes. For a much more better definition, you can saerch on Google or Wikipedia.
        <br>
        So, to be very sensible, climate change is not just an environmental issue, it is also a cultural one. Let us see why is it so. 
        <br>
        <u>Few Reasons, for this problem</u>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>Indigenous Knowledge: Many cultures have knowledge honed over many generations. Climate change affetcts ecosystems, making this knowledge less usable and after some time, the identity of these cultures will be forgotten</li>
            <li>Livelihoods: Rising of sea levels, weather calamities, and other abnormal weather patterns affect the lives of the people</li>
            <br>
            </ul>
        To prevent this from happening, we need to spread awareness about this to many people as much as we can. Some communities already suffering from this are the Artic Communities, Masai People of Africa and the Pacific Islanders.
        <br>
        This was just a brief, I would request you to research more about this and spread awareness to the people
